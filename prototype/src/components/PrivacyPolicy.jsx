      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our application.
        By using our application, you consent to the practices described in this policy.
      </p>

      <h2>Information Collection</h2>
      <p>
        We collect certain personally identifiable information (such as name, email address, and phone number) when you provide it to us through our forms or interactions within the application.
        We may also collect non-personally identifiable information, such as device information and usage data, to improve our application and provide a better user experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Information Usage</h2>
      <p>
        We use the collected information to provide and maintain our application, respond to user inquiries or support requests, personalize user experiences, and send periodic emails or notifications related to our services.
        We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties without your consent, except as required by law or as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement appropriate security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.
        However, no data transmission over the internet or electronic storage method is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        You are responsible for keeping your account credentials and passwords confidential.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to update or modify this privacy policy at any time.
        Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised policy on this page.
        We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates.
